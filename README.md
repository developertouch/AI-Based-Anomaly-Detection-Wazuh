# AI-Based Anomaly Detection in Wazuh

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of **AI-based anomaly detection** in a Wazuh Security Operations Center (SOC) environment using the **OpenSearch Anomaly Detection plugin**. The objective is to move beyond traditional rule-based detections and identify unusual authentication behavior using machine learning.

The project was completed as **Task 4** of the **WazuGuardix SOC Internship**, focusing on hands-on implementation, attack simulation, and analysis.

## 🔥 Attack Simulation (Kali Linux)

To generate anomalous authentication behavior, a controlled SSH brute-force attack was launched from Kali Linux.

**Command Used:**

```bash
hydra -L user.txt -p pass.txt <UBUNTU_IP> ssh -t 4
```

**Attack Description:**

* Multiple failed SSH login attempts
* High-frequency authentication failures
* Simulates brute-force behavior commonly seen in real attacks

### 🔎 Real-Time Anomaly Results

* **Anomaly Grade:** 1.00 (High severity)
* **Confidence:** ~0.18 (Early-stage ML model confidence)
* **Last Occurrence:** Timestamp shown in dashboard

## 🧩 Why This Anomaly Is Security-Relevant

* Indicates brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks
* Identifies threats not caught by static thresholds
* Enhances SOC visibility into abnormal authentication behavior

---

## 🎯 Key Learnings

* AI-based detection complements rule-based SIEM alerts
* Anomaly grade represents severity; confidence improves with more data
* Machine learning enables early detection of unknown attack patterns
* Proper attack simulation is critical for SOC validation
